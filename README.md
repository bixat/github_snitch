## Package for open github issue for crashes, issues & proposals

## Features
- Create labels for package
	- GhSnitch-external for Errors not caught by Flutter Framework

  - Reported by GhSnitch Package for know which issues reported from this package
- Report bugs on github issues with specific labels,assignees, milestone
  - Automaticlly when call `listenToExceptions` method in `main` as in example
  - Manually with `report` method
- Support offline case (save locally & send later when connection exist)

## TODO
- [ ] Fetch issue comments & give user to discuss his issue/proposal from app with repo contributors

üí° Feel free to add any idea 

## Getting started

After install package you need to generate [Personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)
We need also `owner username` & `repo name`

We will use Environment variables for save this sensive keys
## Usage

For run or build app just pass --dart-define for every key as example :

```
flutter build apk --split-per-abi --dart-define owner=owner --dart-define repo=repo --dart-define token=token
```

Then Add this code before runApp method
As you see we used keys from Environment
```dart
WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  const String owner = String.fromEnvironment('owner');
  GhSnitch.initialize(
      owner: owner,
      token: const String.fromEnvironment('token'),
      repo: const String.fromEnvironment("repo"));
  if (!kReleaseMode) {
    // For report exceptions & bugs Automaticlly
    GhSnitch.listenToExceptions(assignees: [owner]);
  }
  runApp(const MyApp());
```
For report issues Manually (from users) check _report method on [`example`](example/lib/main.dart)

If you want to test it in debug mode you can remove ReleaseMode condition
